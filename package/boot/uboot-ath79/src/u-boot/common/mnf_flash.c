         *
         * So it seems like the CPU cache on atheros chips is unaware of memory mapped
         * SPI nor flash and caches any reads/writes to that memory region. Since the flash
         * is written through a seperate channel, the cache does not get updated and subsequent
         * reads end up returning old values. Funnily enough, writes to said memory region do
         * not seem to cause a cpu fault or anything, so we can just 'update' the cache ourselves...
         *
         * And hey, it's not very critical code anyway, just don't breathe at it the wrong way.
